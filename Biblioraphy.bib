	abstract = {Excessive heating of the metal sheet during laser oxygen cutting can cause quality deterioration and even lead to cut loss and possible machine idle time, especially for cutting of thick plates, where the cutting speed is slower. There are at least three different strategies to handle quality deterioration by heat accumulation in flame laser cutting of thick plates: to optimize the process parameters for preheated zones, to generate tool paths that avoid such regions, or to use active cooling to remove the excessive heat. For any of these strategies to work, it is crucial to correctly identify when and where heat accumulations occur. This can be done by real-time temperature measurements, by simulating heat propagation on the metal plate, or by defining empirical criteria based on experimental data. This paper takes a close look at these methods of heat accumulation detection, their advantages and disadvantages, and how they can be integrated into different approaches to tackle unwanted heat accumulations in laser cutting. Furthermore, three case studies are provided, one for each abovementioned method, where the detection of quality degradation due to heat accumulation is demonstrated with a series of experiments. For all case studies, at least one action is proposed to improve the cut quality. All experiments were conducted for 15 mm mild steel plates using a 4 kW industrial fiber laser cutting machine.},

	abstract = {In a considerable proportion of the published work on the subject of laser–oxygen cutting of mild steel, the details of the oxidation reaction are overlooked or confused. For example, it is not uncommon for the oxidized material to be attributed with the physical characteristics of iron rather than iron oxide. Also, the fact that the oxidation reaction cannot take place above a certain temperature limit is usually overlooked. This paper presents, for the ﬁrst time, an in-depth analysis of the Iron to FeO oxidation reaction in the context of laser–oxygen cutting of mild steel. The paper concludes by presenting a number of guidelines for future theoretical models.},

	abstract = {A new approach for minimizing both cutting path and heat accumulation in laser cutting process is presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm was based on a memetic algorithm combining a powerful genetic algorithm with an adaptive large neighborhood search. The cutting path problem was modeled and solved in accordance with generalized traveling salesman problem. A heat conduction model was incorporated into the cutting path optimization by assigning a critical radius of heat-affected zone as a constraint. A penalty was given to the cutting paths overlapping the heat-affected zone to minimize the heat accumulation in workpiece. A heat map indicating thermal gradient around the laser piercing points was also presented together with the optimum cutting path to visualize the level of heat accumulation. By comparing to the approach without the heat constraint, the algorithm incorporating with the heat effect was capable of determining the laser cutting path with minimum travel distance and heat accumulation in workpiece. The presented method could further be applied for other thermal-related processes such as surface hardening, welding, and additive manufacturing, whose processing distance and heat issue need to be optimized for gaining their productivity and final product quality.},

	abstract = {ÐWe propose a flexible new technique to easily calibrate a camera. It only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one more step from laboratory environments to real world use. The corresponding software is available from the author's Web page.},

	abstract = {In geometrical camera calibration the objective is to determine a set of camera parameters that describe the mapping between 3-D reference coordinates and 2-D image coordinates. Various methods for camera calibration can be found from the literature. However, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the whole calibration procedure, i.e., control point extraction from images, model ﬁtting, image correction, and errors originating in these stages. The main interest has been in model ﬁtting, although the other stages are also important. In this paper we present a four-step calibration procedure that is an extension to the two-step method. There is an additional step to compensate for distortion caused by circular features, and a step for correcting the distorted image coordinates. The image correction is performed with an empirical inverse model that accurately compensates for radial and tangential distortions. Finally, a linear method for solving the parameters of the inverse model is presented.},
